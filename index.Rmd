# About

## Book  

This book offers some practical understanding on how to access the Twitter API with R. It assumes an Academic Research access but also some familiarity with R. If you are a student or an academic you can get more information on how to apply [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/products/twitter-api/academic-research/application-info). The book is based on the official Twitter documentation that you can access [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api). 

### Twitter relationships

In collecting Twitter data using the API, there are a number of entry points. Each node in the diagram indicate a possible entry point with arrows indicating the type of API requests necessary to crawl the graph. 

```{r echo = FALSE, results = 'show'}

library(DiagrammeR)
library(data.table)

niv <- 
  c("User A", "User B", "Tweet", "List", "query")
from <- 
  c("User A", "User B", "query", "query", "Tweet", "User B", "List", "User B")
to <- 
  c("User B", "User A", "Tweet", "Tweet", "User A", "Tweet", "User A", "List")

temp <- 
  data.table::data.table(from = factor(from, levels=niv),
                         to = factor(to, levels=niv))

nodes <-   
  DiagrammeR::create_node_df( n=length(niv), label=niv,  width=0.3) 

edges <- 
  DiagrammeR::create_edge_df(from = temp$from, 
                             to = temp$to, 
                             rel = "leading_to", 
                             label = c("get friends", 
                                       "get followers",
                                       "search tweets",
                                       "stream tweets",
                                       "tweet lookup",
                                       "user timeline",
                                       "list members",
                                       "list membership"))

graph <- 
  create_graph(nodes_df = nodes, edges_df = edges)

render_graph(graph)

```
