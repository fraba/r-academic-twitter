It assumes an Academic Research access but also some familiarity with R. If you are a student or an academic you can get more information on how to apply here. The book is based on the official Twitter documentation that you can access here. 1.1.1 Twitter relationships In collecting Twitter data using the API, there are a number of entry points. Each node in the diagram indicate a possible entry point with arrows indicating the type of API requests necessary to crawl the graph. 1.2 Author Francesco Bailo is Lecturer of Digital and Social Media at the University of Technology Sydney, Australia. His research focuses on the use of digital and social media in politics. He obtained his PhD in 2017 at the University of Sydney, Australia.

Of course, if you don’t care you can just store it in a regular variable. 2.3 Interrogating the Twitter API The Twitter API accept two methods to exchange information: POST and GET. Intuitively, with the POST method we send information to a server while with the GET method we retrieve information. With the Twitter API, the GET method is used more frequently. Still, we need to use the POST method to define our search rules before we GET the Filtered stream. This is how a GET request using the httr package looks like: httr::GET(url, httr::add_headers(.headers = headers), query = params) The url is a simple character variable while headers and params are lists. But let’s send a GET request! We need first to set the URL, specify our request headers (these are not going to change, so you can place at the top of your document) and set the parameters fo the query. url &lt;- &quot;https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets/counts/recent&quot; headers &lt;- c(`Authorization` = sprintf(&#39;Bearer %s&#39;, Sys.getenv(&quot;BEARER_TOKEN&quot;))) params &lt;- list(query = &quot;from:TwitterDev&quot;, granularity = &quot;day&quot;) What are we doing here? With url we specify the endpoint we want to use for this API request. The Twitter API has several endpoints. Note that sometimes we need to include parameters here instead of passing them through the HTTP query. headers is the first layer of information that we send over to the server. In this case it contains our token. If this is accepted - the status of the request is 200 OK - then the API is ready to process our request. If the token is not accepted we get as status 401 Unauthorized. Note that these error codes and messages define the status of the HTTP request. The Twitter API has a different set of error codes. In this sense, we can get a 200 OK from the HTTP layer and still get an error (e.g. 429 Too Many Requests) from the API layer (think in stacks!). With params we define the queries with want to append to the URL. Functionally, you can imagine that the list of key-value pairs what we define in list object params are appended after the string we set with url and a ? (for example, in https://example.com/over/there?name=ferret the query is defined by the key-value name=ferret). Now we can add these as attributes to the function GET and collect the response in res. res &lt;- httr::GET(url, httr::add_headers(.headers = headers), query = params) By printing res we see details about the HTTP response (but not yet the API response or the content returned from the API). print(res) ## Response [https://api.twitter.com/2/tweets/counts/recent?query=from%3ATwitterDev&amp;granularity=day] ## Date: 2022-03-03 04:50 ## Status: 401 ## Content-Type: application/problem+json ## Size: 99 B ## &lt;BINARY BODY&gt; ## NULL If our request was authorised we should get Status: 200 if our request was not authorised (likely because your token was not correctly specified) we should instead get Status: 401 Assuming, that we got an OK from the HTTP layer, then we can access the content we receive as a response from the API layer. We access it with the function httr::content(). obj.json &lt;- httr::content(res, as = &quot;text&quot;) Now by default the Twitter API responses are in JSON format. We can use the jsonlite package to translate the JSON-formatted string into an R object with obj.r &lt;- jsonlite::fromJSON(obj.json) print(obj.r) ## $title ## [1] &quot;Unauthorized&quot; ## ## $type ## [1] &quot;about:blank&quot; ## ## $status ## [1] 401 ## ## $detail ## [1] &quot;Unauthorized&quot; And this is information on the number of tweets posted by @TwitterDev in the days before our request.
